           <h1>Hello and welcome to the html lesson!</h1>
           <h2>In this we will be teaching you basic html, don't worry, it is fairly simple</h2>

           <h3>Okay, well let's get right into it then - it may not be as long as the next one you are about to learn but I can assure you that it will be just as informative!</h3>
           <h1>Elements</h1>
           <p class="elements">Html is completely made up of so-called 'elements'. They are the building blocks of html. An element has 3 different parts. (some very similar) The opening tag, content, and finally, the closing tag. You can recognise an opening tag by <> these. The content is what will show up in your website. The closing tag is the exact same apart from the fact that it looks like this </> notice the difference? Yep, there's a slash, see? Easy peasy!
           <h1>Div and Class</h1>
           <p class="elements">You know how I just taught you about elements and how they are the building blocks of html? Well imagine you are in a libary, and tall bookshelves are surrounding you look at the bookshelvess and see how the books are lined up perfectly along the endless-supply of shelves. Well, that is just what a div is! Div are just like the organizer of html, what keeps your code so neat and perfect. A div is just like any element. Except that the content is not any content. The content inside of the div is...more elements! Like h1-h6, images, anchors basically any element existing! inside of a div, you would usually give it a class. This is so you can target the div in html to give it a class, you put it in the opening tag. Like this:<br> div class="demo" <br> Of course you would put crocidile teeth (<>)around them though.</p>
