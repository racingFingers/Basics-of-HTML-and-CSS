           <h1>Firstly, css is made up of rules, as in, every line of code you write will become a temporary rule in your css document...unless of course, you make a mistake. (VERY IMPORTANT to know!)</h1>
           <p>I guess I should tell you more about what css really is. So, you see, html is all of the content that you see - the building blocks that you mostly want to start with, css is what makes it look so nice, the colours, animations, backgrounds etcetera, js is all the interactivity, the alerts that pop up on you screen, the secret that keeps your score for you on a game!</p>

           <h2>In css, most of the time, you would target a class before customizing everything. (If you aren't picking up anything from this explanation, please refer to <a href="hlesson.html">this</a> link)<br> To target a class of a div, (which stands for `divider`. Again, if you don't know this, please refer to <a href="hlesson.html">this</a> link.)<br> you would write it out like this:<br> .div<br> Got that?<br> After that, most people would target the element by simply writing it out like this:<br> .class h1<br> Got that too?<br> Now, you get to the juicy bit -  Actually writing out the rules of code! I'm sorry but just before that, you will have to write out one more thing, the curly braces! Here is an example:<br>.class h1 {}<br>Got that?<br><b>Now</b> we can start having fun! Just make sure you write you code inside of the curly braces. Now try making this h1 become red! Good luck!<br> (Ask Oliver if you need any help)
P.S: The Div class is called lesson and the text underneath is a h1.</h2>
